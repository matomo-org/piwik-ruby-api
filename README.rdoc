= autometal-piwik

* https://github.com/Achillefs/autometal-piwik
* http://humbuckercode.co.uk/licks/gems/piwik

== DESCRIPTION:

A simple Ruby client for the Piwik API. This gem is based on Rodrigo Tassinari de Oliveira's piwik gem (https://github.com/riopro/piwik). Since it hasn't been updated since 2008, I took the liberty to fork it, and finish it up.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Object-oriented interface to the Piwik API;
* For now, only a small subset of the API is implemented (only basic actions)

== SYNOPSIS:

Piwik is an open source web analytics software, written in PHP. It provides an 
extensive REST-like API, and this gem aims to be a simple Ruby wrapper to access 
this API in a Ruby-friendly way. For example:

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'piwik'
  site = Piwik::Site.load(1, 'http://your.piwi.install', 'some_auth_key')
  => #<Piwik::Site:0xb74bf994 @name="Example.com", @config={:auth_token=>"some_auth_key", :piwik_url=>"http://your.piwi.install"}, @id=1, @main_url="http://www.example.com", @created_at=Tue Jul 15 18:55:40 -0300 2008>
  site.pageviews(:month, Date.today)
  => 88
  
  user = Piwik::User.load(1, 'http://your.piwi.install', 'some_auth_key')
  => #<Piwik::User:0xb66bf544 @login="Example.com", @config={:auth_token=>"some_auth_key", :piwik_url=>"http://your.piwi.install"}, @id=1, @main_url="http://www.example.com", @created_at=Tue Jul 15 18:55:40 -0300 2008>

Currently, only Piwik::Site and Piwik::User simple new / create / save / update methods have been implemented.

For more information on Piwik and it's API, see the Piwik website (http://piwik.org) 
and the Piwik API reference (http://dev.piwik.org/trac/wiki/API/Reference).

== REQUIREMENTS:

RubyGems and the following gems (installed automatically if necessary):

  active_support
  xml-simple
  rest-client

== INSTALL:

  sudo gem install autometal-piwik --source=http://gemcutter.org

== CHANGELOG:
 * 0.4.2
   Final fix for inconsistent API outputs caused by Rails using its own version of XmlSimple.
 * 0.4.1
   Quick fixed api result parsing in site creation. The API's responses are inconsistent, but I am not sure why.
 * 0.4.0
   Added Piwik::Trackable controller mixing, pretty much swiped off of halfdan's piwik analytics project (https://github.com/halfdan/piwik_analytics/). The version included in this plugin is not suitable for application tracking, and is instead geared towards tracking multiple websites stored as ActiveRecord models
 * 0.3.0
   UsersManager CRUD implementation, with tests
 * 0.2.3
   Started adding some tests
 * 0.2.0
   Reworked plugin to also look for a rails config file called piwik.yml, and not just the .piwik user prefs file.
 * 0.0.2 2008-07-22 (riopro)
   * Added specs for existing API methods
   * Created RubyForge project at http://rubyforge.org/projects/piwik/
 * 0.0.1 2008-07-21 (riopro)
   * major enhancement:
   * Initial release
